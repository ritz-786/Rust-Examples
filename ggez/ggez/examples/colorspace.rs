//! An example demonstrating sRGB color spaces.
//!
//! sRGB is one of those things that's a bit subtle, a bit obscure,
//! and easy to get wrong, but worth knowing because it crops up
//! from time to time and makes things mysteriously "look wrong" in
//! some cases.  It also is sort of overloaded to do two things at
//! once.  The first is what you will find [Wikipedia talking about](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srgb),
//! which is "how do you prove that 'green' on my monitor is the same
//! as 'green' on your monitor?".  That part we can safely ignore,
//! since it's a job for your monitor manufacturer.
//!
//! The other part is [gamma
//! correction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_correction) which
//! deals with the fact that the response of the human visual system
//! is non-linear, or in non-science talk, if you make a pixel twice
//! as bright, it doesn't *look* twice as bright.  To make something
//! *look* twice as bright, you have to make it about 2^2.2 times
//! brighter.  The exact math for how to fiddle the numbers to make
//! things Look Nice is defined as part of the sRGB standard, so often
//! a color scheme that complies with this gamma correction process is
//! just called "sRGB".
//!
//! In a perfect world, we don't ever have to worry about this.
//! Images are generally all stored in the sRGB color space (or
//! something similar to it), monitors all display in the sRGB color
//! space, and our graphics drivers know how to do whatever is
//! necessary to make the two line up.  The problem comes because we
//! are programmers, and have to be able to poke things instead of
//! just using pre-loaded assets.  So the question is: if you do
//! `Color::new(0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0)` and `Color::new(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0)`,
//! will the second color LOOK twice as bright as the first one?
//!
//! So we have to know what color space we are talking about when we
//! say `Color`!  Are we talking about linear, "real" color where your
//! pixel puts out twice as many photons for the second color as the
//! first?  Or are we talking about sRGB color, where the pixel
//! actually LOOKS twice as bright?  And if we want to, say, write a
//! shader that does math to these colors, AND to colors that come
//! from images that use the sRGB color space, how do we make sure
//! everything matches?  To make it even worse, the sRGB conversion
//! done by graphics drivers is toggle-able, and can be set on a
//! per-render-target or per-texture basis, so it's possible for
//! things to get REAL mixed up in subtle ways.
//!
//! The Right Answer, as far as I know, is this: All colors that a
//! human specifies or touches are sRGB-encoded, so a number that is
//! twice as big then .  We do our color math in shaders, and (if we
//! set our render target to be an sRGB texture, which ggez always
//! does) the graphics driver will turn the linear colors we specify
//! into sRGB colors.  So if we do `vec4 x = vec4(0.25, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0);`,
//! assigning one pixel `x` and another `x * 2` will make the
//! second one *look* twice as bright as the first.
//!
//! BUT, this process also has to be done on INPUT as well; if we pass
//! the shader a value taken from an image file, that image file is in
//! sRGB color.  The graphics driver must THEN convert the sRGB color into
//! a linear color when passing it to the shader, so that if we get the
//! color and call it `x`, assigning one output pixel `x` and another
//! `x * 2` again makes the second one LOOK twice as bright as the first.
//! Then it converts the value back on the way out.
//!
//! ggez should handle all of this for you.  `graphics::Color` is
//! explicitly a sRGB-corrected color, all textures including the
//! final render target are sRGB-enabled, and when you provide
//! a linear color to something like `graphics::Mesh` it turns it
//! into sRGB for you to match everything else.  The purpose of this
//! example is to show that this actually *works* correctly!
